    <h1>World Cup News</h1>
    <p>The biggest scoreline in the history of the
        <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001,
        when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.
    </p>
    <p>
        This legendary match also brought global renown for <em>Archie Thompson</em>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record,
        which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.
    </p>
    <p>
        And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that
        it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, '<em>Next Goal Wins</em>', showing across the world.
