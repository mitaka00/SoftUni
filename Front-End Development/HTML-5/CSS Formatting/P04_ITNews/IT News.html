        <h1>You can preorder Intel's Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs next week</h1>
        <time>14, 2017</time>
        <p class="text">Intel formally introduced its Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor lineup at Computex last month, but at
            the time it didn't say anything about a specific release date. It turns out that Intel was waiting for
            E3 to announce availability. Starting on June 19 (this coming Monday), some of Intel's Core-X series
            CPUs will be available to preorder.

        <time>June 12, 2017</time>
        <p class="text">Several weeks ago Microsoft lifted the covers slightly off its new next-gen console, codenamed Project
            Scorpio. Today, the software giant took the full wraps off what is now called the Xbox One X, which
            launches this year for $500. Here's the lowdown on how powerful Scorpio is, and how
            it compares to a gaming PC.

        <h1>Buy a GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti, get Destiny 2 free with early beta access</h1>
        <time>June 10, 2017</time>
        <p class="text">Nvidia's got a sweet deal lined up for its next graphics card bundle. If you buy a GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti,
            you can snag a free copy of Destiny 2, and get in on the game's PC beta in the process. And it's not
            just any old beta access. It's [Early] Access, according to Nvidia. Why is Early in brackets? Who knows!
            But the point is, you get Destiny 2 and can try it out before the release date on October 24.
